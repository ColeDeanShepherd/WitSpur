  my_AND has two inputs and one output, so let's create some registers and
  wires to hook it up to a test circuit.

  Registers are storage locations for values which we can change over time,
  whereas wires are simply a means of transporting a value from one place in
  a circuit to another.

  To test our AND module, we want to manually change its two inputs and
  ensure that its output is what we expect. So, to allow us to manually change
  the inputs over time we need to create two registers, and to allow us to
  observe the output of our module, we need to create a wire.

  // Now we create an instance of the "my_AND" module called "m", and connect
  // our registers and wire to the module. To connect registers or wires to
  // inputs or outputs of a module, type a ".", followed by the name of the
  // input or output in the module, followed by the name of the register/wire
  // we wish to connect to the input/output port surrounded by parenthesis.
