// This is a single-line comment. Single-line comments begin with "//" and
// continue until the end of the line.

// Now for multi-line comments.
// Multi-line comments begin with "/*" and end with "*/".

/*
This is a multi-line comment. Multi-line comments can span multiple lines,
and are useful for including detailed documentation or temporarily diabling
blocks of code.
*/

/*
Unfortunately, multi-line comments cannot be nested in Verilog. So, you cannot
include a multi-line comment inside another multi-line comment. This can be
problematic when attempting to comment out large blocks of code which may
include multi-line comments themselves.
