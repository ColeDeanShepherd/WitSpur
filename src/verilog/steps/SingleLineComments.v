// This is a single-line comment.
// Single-line comments begin with "//" and continue until the end of the line.

// Comments are used to document code, temporarily disable code, and more.

// You should strive to make your code as readable as possible without relying
// on comments as a crutch, but comments are useful for including additional
// information that the code itself cannot convey.
